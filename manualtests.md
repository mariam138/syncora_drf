| Tested Feature                        | Expected Outcome                                                                                                                                        | Pass/Fail | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Profile creation                      | When a new user registers, a profile is automatically created for them with a default profile picture                                                   | Pass      | When creating the superuser, I had written the wrong file path for the default image so my image wasn't correct, but an image was appearing in the admin panel. This was then fixed for future profiles.                                                                                                                                |
| View list of profiles                 | At the '/profiles/' URL, a list of profiles can be seen                                                                                                 | Pass      | This was tested before adjusting the serialiser to display more specific fields. This API endpoint is only for testing purposes to see that profiles are being made correctly, and will not be used for the front end. Passes as well after adding custom serialiser fields.                                                            |
| Retrieve profile by id                | When typing 'profiles/:id/ as the URL, retrieve one profile associated with that id                                                                     | Pass      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Edit profile picture on profile by id | If you are the owner of the profile, the profile picture can be changed. No options to update the profile should be available if user is not the owner. | Pass      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Delete profile by id                  | When owner of the profile, I am able to click 'delete' to delete my profile.                                                                            | Pass      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Edit name on profile by id            | If you are the owner of the profile, you are able to update your name.                                                                                  | Fail      | Due to using dot notation to access the first_name field of the User model, this required creating my own update() method for the serialiser. Due to the more complicated nature and time constraints, I decided to remove the ability to edit a name for this project. However this is a feature that can be brought in in the future. |
